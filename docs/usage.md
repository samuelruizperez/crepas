## Samplesheet input

You will need to create a samplesheet with information about the samples you would like to analyse before running the pipeline. Use the `--input` parameter to specify its location:

```bash
--input <path_to_samplesheet_csv>
```
It has to be a comma-separated (`.csv`) file with with at least the `sample`, `biological_replicate`, `exp_type` and `fastq_1` columns, and a header row as explained below. The columns can be provided in any order:

| Column (header)   | Description | Type | Required |
| -------- | ----------- | --------- | -------- |
| `sample` |  Custom sample (or condition) name. This identifier must be the same for all biological and technical replicates of the same sample; just specify a `biological_replicate` appropriately. For output file naming purposes, the sequencing experiment type is parsed from the `exp_type` column and prepended to the `sample` identifier, so you should avoid including the experiment type as part of the `sample` name. It cannot contain spaces. | `string` | true |
| `biological_replicate` | String or integer representing the biological replicate. This identifier should be identical for re-sequenced libraries (technical replicates). If you do not have biological replicates you can set the `biological_replicate` to any number or string for each of your samples. It cannot contain spaces. | `string` or `integer` | true |
| `technical_replicate` | Identifier representing the technical replicate. It cannot contain spaces. | `string` or `integer` |  |
| `input_control` | This column should contain the `sample` identifier of the corresponding input control for that sample. It should be empty if an input control is not available or in the case of input control rows. | `string` |  |
| `input_control_biological_replicate` | String or integer representing the biological replicate of the corresponding input control sample. It should be empty in the case of input control rows. | `string` or `integer` |  |
| `input_control_technical_replicate` | String or integer representing the technical replicate of the corresponding input control sample. It should be empty in the case of input control rows. | `string` or `integer` |  |
| `exp_type` | One of `ChIP-seq`, `ATAC-seq`, `SCAR-seq`, `ChOR-seq`, `ChIP-exo`, `OK-seq`, `CUT&RUN`, `CUT&Tag`, `TIP-seq` | `string` | true |
| `strandedness` | Either `forward` or `reverse`: <br><br><ul><li>If the library was prepared using NGS indexed PentAdapter™ adapters (PentaBase ApS, Denmark), as in the [SCAR-seq paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41596-021-00585-3), set this to `forward`.</li><li>If the library was prepared using [xGen™ UDI-UMI Adapters](https://eu.idtdna.com/page/products/next-generation-sequencing/ngs-adapters-indexing-primers) (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.), the [insert strandedness is flipped](https://eu.idtdna.com/pages/support/faqs/can-the-xgen-unique-dual-index-umi-adapters-be-used-for-rna-seq), so set this to `reverse`.</li></ul><br>This field is only relevant for SCAR-seq and OK-seq; leave it empty for unstranded data (ChIP-seq, ChIP-exo, ChOR-seq, or ATAC-seq). | `string` |  |
| `antibody` | This column is required to separate the downstream consensus peak merging for different antibodies. It is not advisable to generate a consensus peak set across different antibodies especially if their binding patterns are inherently different e.g. narrow transcription factors and broad histone marks. It should be empty in the case of input control rows. | `string` |  |
| `fastq_1` | GZIP-compressed FastQ file for reads 1. Must have the extension `.fastq.gz` or `.fq.gz`. | `string` (`file-path`) | true |
| `fastq_2` | GZIP-compressed FastQ file for reads 2. Must have the extension `.fastq.gz` or `.fq.gz`. Leave empty for single-end data. | `string` (`file-path`) |  |
| `fastq_umi` | GZIP-compressed FastQ file for UMI reads. Must have the extension `.fastq.gz` or `.fq.gz`. Leave empty if a separate UMI file is not available. | `string` (`file-path`) |  |


### Example 1: Multiple biological replicates

This is an example of a samplesheet for a ChIP-seq experiment with one condition and two biological replicates for each antibody:

| sample | fastq_1 | fastq_2 | fastq_umi | biological_replicate | exp_type | strandedness | antibody | input_control | input_control_biological_replicate |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| condition_1_H3K9me3 | condition_1_bRep1_H3K9me3_R1.fastq.gz | condition_1_bRep1_H3K9me3_R3.fastq.gz | condition_1_bRep1_H3K9me3_R2.fastq.gz | 1 | ChIP-seq | | H3K9me3 | condition_1_INPUT | 1 |
| condition_1_H3K9me3 | condition_1_bRep2_H3K9me3_R1.fastq.gz | condition_1_bRep2_H3K9me3_R3.fastq.gz | condition_1_bRep2_H3K9me3_R2.fastq.gz | 2 | ChIP-seq | | H3K9me3 | condition_1_INPUT | 2 |
| condition_1_H3K27ac | condition_1_bRep1_H3K27ac_R1.fastq.gz | condition_1_bRep1_H3K27ac_R3.fastq.gz | condition_1_bRep1_H3K27ac_R2.fastq.gz | 1 | ChIP-seq | | H3K27ac | condition_1_INPUT | 1 |
| condition_1_H3K27ac | condition_1_bRep2_H3K27ac_R1.fastq.gz | condition_1_bRep2_H3K27ac_R3.fastq.gz | condition_1_bRep2_H3K27ac_R2.fastq.gz | 2 | ChIP-seq | | H3K27ac | condition_1_INPUT | 2 |
| condition_1_INPUT | condition_1_bRep1_INPUT_R1.fastq.gz | condition_1_bRep1_INPUT_R3.fastq.gz | condition_1_bRep1_INPUT_R2.fastq.gz | 1 | ChIP-seq | | | | |
| condition_1_INPUT | condition_1_bRep2_INPUT_R1.fastq.gz | condition_1_bRep2_INPUT_R3.fastq.gz | condition_1_bRep2_INPUT_R2.fastq.gz | 2 | ChIP-seq | | | | |

> You can download this example samplesheet [here](../assets/samplesheets/ex1_multiBioRep_samplesheet.csv).

### Example 2: Multiple runs of the same library (technical replicates)

Both the `sample` and `biological_replicate` identifiers have to be the same when you have sequenced the same sample more than once e.g. to increase sequencing depth. The pipeline will perform the alignments in parallel, and subsequently merge them before further analysis.

> [!NOTE]
> As shown below, the `technical_replicate` column is optional; if not provided for any specific biological replicate, the pipeline will assign an integer indentifier [1, 2, ...] to each technical replicate of that biological replicate. On the other hand, if you do want your technical-replicate-level output files to be named with a specific identifier, you should specify the `technical_replicate` column in the samplesheet.


This is an example of a samplesheet for a ChIP-seq experiment with one condition, two biological replicates for each antibody, and two technical replicates for each biological replicate:

| sample | fastq_1 | fastq_2 | fastq_umi | biological_replicate | exp_type | strandedness | antibody | input_control | input_control_biological_replicate |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |

## Reference genome files

### Genome index, FASTA, GTF/GFF and gene BED files

The minimum reference genome requirements are a FASTA and a GTF file, all other files required to run the pipeline can be generated from these files. However, it is more storage and compute friendly if you are able to re-use reference genome files as efficiently as possible. It is recommended to use the `--save_reference` parameter if you are using the pipeline to build new indices (e.g. those unavailable on [AWS iGenomes](https://nf-co.re/usage/reference_genomes)) so that you can save them somewhere locally. The index building step can be quite a time-consuming process and it permits their reuse for future runs of the pipeline to save disk space. You can then either provide the appropriate reference genome files on the command-line via the appropriate parameters (e.g. `--bwa_index '/path/to/bwa/index/'`) or via a [custom config file](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#custom-configuration-files).

<!-- - If `--genome` is provided then the FASTA and GTF files (and existing indices) will be automatically obtained from AWS-iGenomes unless these have already been downloaded locally in the path specified by `--igenomes_base`. -->
- If `--gene_bed` is not provided then it will be generated from the GTF file.

> **NB:** Compressed reference files are also supported by the pipeline i.e. standard files with the `.gz` extension and indices folders with the `tar.gz` extension.

### Genome blacklist regions

The blacklist bed files where obtained using the commands below:

```console
cd ..
mkdir -p v1.0
cd v1.0
wget -L https://www.encodeproject.org/files/ENCFF001TDO/@@download/ENCFF001TDO.bed.gz && gunzip ENCFF001TDO.bed.gz && mv ENCFF001TDO.bed hg19-blacklist.v1.bed

mkdir -p assets/blacklists/v2.0/
cd assets/blacklists/v2.0/

```

> **NB:** A detailed description of the different versions of the files can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/site/anshulkundaje/projects/blacklists). Also, to to see which blacklist bed files are assigned by default to the respective reference genome check the [igenomes.config](conf/igenomes.config).

## Running the pipeline

The typical command for running the pipeline is as follows:

```bash
nextflow run grothlab/crepas \
  -profile docker \
  --input samplesheet.csv \
  --genome GRCh37 \
  --outdir <OUTDIR>
```

This will launch the pipeline with the `docker` configuration profile. See below for more information about profiles.

Note that the pipeline will create the following files in your working directory:

```bash
work                # Directory containing the nextflow working files
<OUTDIR>            # Finished results in specified location (defined with --outdir)
.nextflow.log       # Log file from Nextflow
# Other nextflow hidden files, eg. history of pipeline runs and old logs.
```

If you wish to repeatedly use the same parameters for multiple runs, rather than specifying each flag in the command, you can specify these in a params file.

Pipeline settings can be provided in a `yaml` or `json` file via `-params-file <file>`.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not use `-c <file>` to specify parameters as this will result in errors. Custom config files specified with `-c` must only be used for [tuning process resource specifications](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/configuration#tuning-workflow-resources), other infrastructural tweaks (such as output directories), or module arguments (args).
> The above pipeline run specified with a params file in yaml format:

```bash
nextflow run grothlab/crepas -profile docker -params-file params.yaml
```

with `params.yaml` containing:

```yaml
input: './samplesheet.csv'
outdir: './results/'
genome: 'GRCh37'
input: 'data'
<...>
```

You can also generate such `YAML`/`JSON` files via [nf-core/launch](https://nf-co.re/launch).

### Updating the pipeline

When you run the above command, Nextflow automatically pulls the pipeline code from GitHub and stores it as a cached version. When running the pipeline after this, it will always use the cached version if available - even if the pipeline has been updated since. To make sure that you're running the latest version of the pipeline, make sure that you regularly update the cached version of the pipeline:

```bash
nextflow pull grothlab/crepas
```


### Reproducibility

#### Running a specific version of the pipeline (`-r`)

It is a good idea to specify a pipeline version when running the pipeline on your data. This ensures that a specific version of the pipeline code and software are used when you run your pipeline. If you keep using the same tag, you'll be running the same version of the pipeline, even if there have been changes to the code since.

To run a specific version of the pipeline, use the [`-r` option](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/reference/cli.html). For example:

- With a [release tag](https://github.com/grothlab/crepas/releases) from the pipeline's repository:

  ```bash
  nextflow run grothlab/crepas \
    -r 1.1.12
  ```

- With a [commit](https://github.com/grothlab/crepas/commits/dev/) ID (revision number) from the pipeline's repository:

  ```bash
  nextflow run grothlab/crepas \
    -r a6840348453bebe2cb49384f8522bbfb20d7087b
  ```

  You can also use the short version of the commit ID:

  ```bash
  nextflow run grothlab/crepas \
    -r a684034
  ```
- With a [git branch](https://github.com/grothlab/crepas/branches) from the pipeline's repository:

  ```bash
  nextflow run grothlab/crepas \
    -r dev
  ```

> [!NOTE]
> In this last example, the pipeline will run with the latest **cached** version of the `dev` branch. Make sure to run `nextflow pull grothlab/crepas -r dev` before if you want to update the cached version.

The version number you use will be logged in reports when you run the pipeline, so that you'll know what you used when you look back in the future. For example, at the bottom of the MultiQC reports.

#### Sharing and reusing parameter files (`-params-file`)

To further assist in reproducibility, you can use share and re-use [parameter files](#running-the-pipeline) to repeat pipeline runs with the same settings without having to write out a command with every single parameter.



> [!TIP]
> If you wish to share such profile (such as upload as supplementary material for academic publications), make sure to NOT include cluster specific paths to files, nor institutional specific profiles.

### Core Nextflow arguments

> [!NOTE]
> These options are part of Nextflow and use a _single_ hyphen (pipeline parameters use a double-hyphen).

#### `-profile`

Use this parameter to choose a configuration profile. Profiles can give configuration presets for different compute environments.

Several generic profiles are bundled with the pipeline which instruct the pipeline to use software packaged using different methods (Docker, Singularity, Podman, Shifter, Charliecloud, Apptainer, Conda) - see below.

> We highly recommend the use of Docker or Singularity containers for full pipeline reproducibility, however when this is not possible, Conda is also supported.

The pipeline also dynamically loads configurations from [https://github.com/nf-core/configs](https://github.com/nf-core/configs) when it runs, making multiple config profiles for various institutional clusters available at run time. For more information and to see if your system is available in these configs please see the [nf-core/configs documentation](https://github.com/nf-core/configs#documentation).

Note that multiple profiles can be loaded, for example: `-profile test,docker` - the order of arguments is important!
They are loaded in sequence, so later profiles can overwrite earlier profiles.

If `-profile` is not specified, the pipeline will run locally and expect all software to be installed and available on the `PATH`. This is _not_ recommended, since it can lead to different results on different machines dependent on the computer enviroment.

- `test`
  - A profile with a complete configuration for automated testing
  - Includes links to test data so needs no other parameters
- `docker`
  - A generic configuration profile to be used with [Docker](https://docker.com/)
- `singularity`
  - A generic configuration profile to be used with [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/docs/)
- `podman`
  - A generic configuration profile to be used with [Podman](https://podman.io/)
- `shifter`
  - A generic configuration profile to be used with [Shifter](https://nersc.gitlab.io/development/shifter/how-to-use/)
- `charliecloud`
  - A generic configuration profile to be used with [Charliecloud](https://hpc.github.io/charliecloud/)
- `apptainer`
  - A generic configuration profile to be used with [Apptainer](https://apptainer.org/)
- `conda`
  - A generic configuration profile to be used with [Conda](https://conda.io/docs/). Please only use Conda as a last resort i.e. when it's not possible to run the pipeline with Docker, Singularity, Podman, Shifter, Charliecloud, or Apptainer.

#### `-resume`

Specify this when restarting a pipeline. Nextflow will use cached results from any pipeline steps where the inputs are the same, continuing from where it got to previously. For input to be considered the same, not only the names must be identical but the files' contents as well. For more info about this parameter, see [this blog post](https://www.nextflow.io/blog/2019/demystifying-nextflow-resume.html).

You can also supply a run name to resume a specific run: `-resume [run-name]`. Use the `nextflow log` command to show previous run names.

#### `-c`

Specify the path to a specific config file (this is a core Nextflow command). See the [nf-core website documentation](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration) for more information.

### Custom configuration

#### Resource requests

Whilst the default requirements set within the pipeline will hopefully work for most people and with most input data, you may find that you want to customise the compute resources that the pipeline requests. Each step in the pipeline has a default set of requirements for number of CPUs, memory and time. For most of the steps in the pipeline, if the job exits with any of the error codes specified [here](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/blob/4c27ef5610c87db00c3c5a3eed10b1d161abf575/conf/base.config#L18) it will automatically be resubmitted with higher requests (2 x original, then 3 x original). If it still fails after the third attempt then the pipeline execution is stopped.

To change the resource requests, please see the [max resources](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/configuration#max-resources) and [tuning workflow resources](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/configuration#tuning-workflow-resources) section of the nf-core website.

#### Custom Containers

In some cases you may wish to change which container or conda environment a step of the pipeline uses for a particular tool. By default nf-core pipelines use containers and software from the [biocontainers](https://biocontainers.pro/) or [bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/) projects. However in some cases the pipeline specified version maybe out of date.

To use a different container from the default container or conda environment specified in a pipeline, please see the [updating tool versions](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/configuration#updating-tool-versions) section of the nf-core website.

#### Custom Tool Arguments

A pipeline might not always support every possible argument or option of a particular tool used in pipeline. Fortunately, nf-core pipelines provide some freedom to users to insert additional parameters that the pipeline does not include by default.

To learn how to provide additional arguments to a particular tool of the pipeline, please see the [customising tool arguments](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/configuration#customising-tool-arguments) section of the nf-core website.

#### nf-core/configs

In most cases, you will only need to create a custom config as a one-off but if you and others within your organisation are likely to be running nf-core pipelines regularly and need to use the same settings regularly it may be a good idea to request that your custom config file is uploaded to the `nf-core/configs` git repository. Before you do this please can you test that the config file works with your pipeline of choice using the `-c` parameter. You can then create a pull request to the `nf-core/configs` repository with the addition of your config file, associated documentation file (see examples in [`nf-core/configs/docs`](https://github.com/nf-core/configs/tree/master/docs)), and amending [`nfcore_custom.config`](https://github.com/nf-core/configs/blob/master/nfcore_custom.config) to include your custom profile.

See the main [Nextflow documentation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/config.html) for more information about creating your own configuration files.

If you have any questions or issues please send us a message on [Slack](https://nf-co.re/join/slack) on the [`#configs` channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/channels/configs).

#### Azure Resource Requests

To be used with the `azurebatch` profile by specifying the `-profile azurebatch`.
We recommend providing a compute `params.vm_type` of `Standard_D16_v3` VMs by default but these options can be changed if required.

Note that the choice of VM size depends on your quota and the overall workload during the analysis.
For a thorough list, please refer the [Azure Sizes for virtual machines in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes).

### Running in the background

Nextflow handles job submissions and supervises the running jobs. The Nextflow process must run until the pipeline is finished.

The Nextflow `-bg` flag launches Nextflow in the background, detached from your terminal so that the workflow does not stop if you log out of your session. The logs are saved to a file.

Alternatively, you can use `screen` / `tmux` or similar tool to create a detached session which you can log back into at a later time.

Some HPC setups also allow you to run nextflow within a cluster job submitted your job scheduler (from where it submits more jobs). For example, the nextflow head job can be submitted to `SLURM` by saving the following script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

#SBATCH --job-name=CREPAS_JOB        # specify a name for the job
#SBATCH --mail-type=END,FAIL        # mail events (NONE, BEGIN, END, FAIL, ALL)
#SBATCH --mail-user=NONE            # email address to receive the notifications
#SBATCH -c 1                        # number of requested cores for the Nextflow head job
#SBATCH --mem=4gb                   # total requested RAM for the Nextflow head job
#SBATCH --time=2-00:00:00           # max. running time of the pipeline job, format in D-HH:MM:SS
#SBATCH --output=crepas_job.%j.log   # standard output and error log, '%j' gives the job ID

# Create an output directory for the pipeline run if it does not exist
mkdir -p <path_to_output_directory>
cd <path_to_output_directory>

# Run the pipeline
nextflow run grothlab/crepas \
    -r main \
    -profile test_scarseq \
    --outdir <path_to_output_directory>
```
And then, submitting the job to the queue with:

```bash
sbatch crepas_job.sh
```
> [!TIP]
> We recommend providing 4 GB of RAM for the Nextflow head job. In the case of an `sbatch` script, this is specified with the `#SBATCH --mem=4gb` line. See [Optimizing Nextflow for HPC and cloud at scale](https://seqera.io/blog/optimizing-nextflow-for-hpc-and-cloud-at-scale/) for more details.

### Nextflow memory requirements

In some cases, the Nextflow Java virtual machines can start to request a large amount of memory.
We recommend adding the following line to your environment to limit this (typically in `~/.bashrc` or `~./bash_profile`):

```bash
NXF_OPTS='-Xms1g -Xmx4g'
```

## Examples

### Setting the environment

Before analyzing any kind of data, we need to install or load Nextflow and a container runtime, as explained in the [Quick start section of the README](../README.md#quick-start).

> [!NOTE]
> In this case, we will use [*SBATCH (SLURM)*](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html) to schedule jobs and
> [*modules*](https://modules.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to load Nextflow, and [*singularity*](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/)
> to run the containerized software in the pipeline. However, these choices
> may vary depending on your specific computing environment, so should check your local documentation.


First, we create a directory structure for our project:

```bash
mkdir ${HOME}/projects/project1
```




### Analyzing OK-seq data

#### Downloading the data

For this example, we will replicate the initiation zone and fork directionality analyses from the following article:

> Petryk, N., Dalby, M., Wenger, A., Stromme, C. B., Strandsby, A., Andersson, R., & Groth, A. (2018). MCM2 promotes symmetric inheritance of modified histones during DNA replication. *Science*, *361*(6409), 1389–1392. [https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aau0294](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aau0294)

First, we need to download the OK-seq data. We will do so using the [nf-core/fetchngs](https://nf-co.re/fetchngs/latest) pipeline, which works very well to fetch metadata and raw FastQ files from public databases, including the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).

We create a subdirectory for nf-core/fetchngs files:

```bash
mkdir -p ${HOME}/projects/project1/fetchngs/
```

##### Input IDs file

We then create a CSV file with the SRA IDs of the samples we want to download.
In this case, we want the OK-seq data from the Petryk et al. 2018 paper, which is available under accession [SRR7535256](https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/index.html?view=run_browser&acc=SRR7535256&display=download). Therefore, the file CSV should look like this:

```csv
SRR7535256
```
And we save it as `project1.fetchngs.input.csv` in the `fetchngs` subdirectory.

##### SBATCH script

Now, we will create an **SBATCH script** to submit the job to the cluster queue. You can use the following template. 

```bash
#!/bin/bash

#SBATCH --job-name=FETCHNGS            # specify a name for the job
#SBATCH --mail-type=END,FAIL           # mail events (NONE, BEGIN, END, FAIL, ALL)
#SBATCH --mail-user=NONE               # email address to receive the notifications
#SBATCH -c 1                           # number of requested cores for the Nextflow head job
#SBATCH --mem=4gb                      # total requested RAM for the Nextflow head job
#SBATCH --time=2-00:00:00              # max. running time of the pipeline job, format in D-HH:MM:SS
#SBATCH --output=fetchngs_job.%j.log   # standard output and error log, '%j' gives the job ID

# Load the required modules
module load openjdk/20.0.0 nextflow/25.04.4 singularity/3.8.7

# Create an output directory for the pipeline's output
mkdir -p ${HOME}/projects/project1/fetchngs/output/
cd ${HOME}/projects/project1/fetchngs/output/

# Run the pipeline
nextflow run nf-core/fetchngs \
    -r 1.11.0 \
    -profile ku_sund_danhead_mod \
    --input ${HOME}/projects/project1/fetchngs/project1.fetchngs.input.csv \
    --outdir ${HOME}/projects/project1/fetchngs/output/
```

Then place the script in your project directory, e.g., as `project1.fetchngs.sbatch.sh`.

Your folder structure should so far look something like this:

```
projects/
└── project1/
    └── fetchngs/
        ├── project1.fetchngs.input.csv
        └── project1.fetchngs.sbatch.sh
```

##### Submitting the job

We can then submit the job to the queue with:

```bash
cd ${HOME}/projects/project1/fetchngs/
sbatch project1.fetchngs.sbatch.sh
```

You can then monitor the job status using `squeue` or by looking at the `fetchngs_job.%j.log` file in the `fetchngs` directory. You can also check the `.nextflow.log` file in the `fetchngs/output/` directory for more detailed logs.

When this job is finished, you should have the raw FastQ file `SRX4403092_SRR7535256.fastq.gz` downloaded in the `fetchngs/output/fastq/` subdirectory.

#### Running CREPAS

Now that we have the data, we can run the *CREPAS* pipeline to analyze it. We will create another subdirectory for the *CREPAS* files:

```bash
mkdir -p ${HOME}/projects/project1/crepas/
```
##### Input samplesheet CSV

Then, we need to create a samplesheet CSV file for the *CREPAS* pipeline. This file should contain information about the samples we want to analyze. For this example, we will create a file called `project1.crepas.samplesheet.csv` in the `crepas` subdirectory with the following content:

```csv
sample,fastq_1,biological_replicate,exp_type,strandedness
SRR7535256,<PATH>/projects/project1/fetchngs/output/fastq/SRX4403092_SRR7535256.fastq.gz,1,OK-seq,forward
```

>[!NOTE]
> Make sure to replace `<PATH>` with the actual **full path** to your project directory.

##### Parameter YAML file

Next, since the CREPAS pipeline has many more parameters, we will compile them into a parameter YAML file for easier management. The file should contain:

```yaml
input: /home/whq695/datadir/projects/OK_seq_SRR7535256/crepas/OK_seq_SRR7535256.crepas.samplesheet.csv
outdir: /home/whq695/datadir/projects/OK_seq_SRR7535256/crepas/output_mm10_bowtie2
bowtie2_index: /home/whq695/datadir/reference_files/GRCm38/bowtie2_2.5.4_index
fasta: /home/whq695/datadir/reference_files/GRCm38/GRCm38.primary_assembly.genome.fa.gz
gtf: /home/whq695/datadir/reference_files/GRCm38/gencode.vM25.primary_assembly.annotation.gtf.gz
blacklist: /home/whq695/datadir/reference_files/GRCm38/GRCm38.ENCODE_ENCFF999QPV.Kundaje.unified_Excludable.bed.gz
aligner: bowtie2

seq_platform: ILLUMINA
read_length: 75
fragment_size: 200
partition_fragment_size: 200
skip_macs3: true
multiqc_title: OK_seq_SRR7535256
skip_umi_extract: true
with_umi: false
trim_full_length: false
trim_minimum_length: 10
trim_maximum_length: 70
trim_nextseq: 0
trim_stringency: 1
trim_error_rate: 0.1
trim_q_cutoff: 20
skip_flT3: true
skip_flTbl: false
save_partition_intermeds: true
skip_plot_profile: true
skip_plot_fingerprint: true
skip_spp: true
```

>[!NOTE]
> You can of course adjust any of these parameters or the other parameters of the pipeline, but in this case, since we want our results to be as similar as possible to those in the original Petryk et al. 2018 paper, we will set them as shown above.

Save this file as `project1.crepas.params.yaml` in the `crepas/` subdirectory.

##### SBATCH script

Now, we will create an **SBATCH script** to submit the *CREPAS* job to the cluster queue. You can use the following template. 

```bash

```


##### Submitting the job


### Analyzing ChIP-seq data

For this example, we will analyze a subset of the ChIP-seq data from the following article:

> Flury, V., Reverón-Gómez, N., Alcaraz, N., Stewart-Morgan, K. R., Wenger, A., Klose, R. J., & Groth, A. (2023). Recycling of modified H2A-H2B provides short-term memory of chromatin states. Cell, 186(5), 1050-1065.e19. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2023.01.007


#### Downloading the data

Now we need to download the ChIP-seq data. We will do so using the [nf-core/fetchngs](https://nf-co.re/fetchngs/latest) pipeline, which works very well to fetch metadata and raw FastQ files from public databases.
